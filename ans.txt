Q.1 Explain the nodejs event driven architecture.
Ans.  At the core of Node.js event-driven architecture is the Event Loop, which is a constantly running loop that waits for events to occur and then triggers the appropriate callbacks. An event is anything that requires attention from the application, such as an incoming HTTP request or a database query. When an event occurs, it's added to the event queue, which is a data structure that holds all pending events.

Q.2 How can it basically scale to handle 1000 of requests a sec. What helps node JS even though it is single threaded?
Ans. because of following factors
  a. Asynchronous I/O:
  b. Event Loop
  c. Cluster Module
  d. Caching
  e. Lightweight

Q.3 What does process.exit do?
Ans.  process. exit() will force the process to exit as quickly as possible even if there are still asynchronous operations pending that have not yet completed fully,

Q.4 What does req.url , req.header and req.method contain?
Ans.  req.url-> This property contains the URL that the client requested.
      req.header-> This property contains an object that represents the HTTP headers that were included in the request.
      req.method-> This property contains the HTTP method that was used for the request.
